In ASP.NET Core MVC, a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit value that is used to identify a unique entity or record in a database or system. GUIDs are generated using algorithms that ensure a high degree of randomness and uniqueness, which makes them ideal for use in distributed systems where conflicts between identifiers can occur.

To use GUIDs in ASP.NET Core MVC, you can define a property in your model with the System.Guid data type. For example, suppose you have a Product model that represents a product in an e-commerce application. You can define a property named Id with the Guid data type
