what does async needs Task while eturning data

In C#, when a method is marked as async, it means that it is designed to run asynchronously, 
which allows the calling code to continue executing while the asynchronous operation is in progress.

When an async method returns data, it needs to return a Task or a Task<T>, 
where T is the type of the data being returned. This is because the data is being returned as a result of an asynchronous operation,
 which means that the data may not be immediately available when the method is called. 
Instead, the Task object represents the ongoing operation, and the calling code can use it to monitor the progress of the operation, 
wait for it to complete, or cancel it if needed.
