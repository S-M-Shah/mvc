FirstOrDefaultAsync returns null if nothing is found; otherwise, it returns the first row found that satisfies the query filter criteria. FirstOrDefaultAsync is generally a better choice than the following alternatives:

SingleOrDefaultAsync - Throws an exception if there's more than one entity that satisfies the query filter. To determine if more than one row could be returned by the query, SingleOrDefaultAsync tries to fetch multiple rows. This extra work is unnecessary if the query can only return one entity, as when it searches on a unique key.

FindAsync - Finds an entity with the primary key (PK). If an entity with the PK is being tracked by the context, it's returned without a request to the database. This method is optimized to look up a single entity, but you can't call Include with FindAsync. So if related data is needed, FirstOrDefaultAsync is the better choice.

Any return true and False
